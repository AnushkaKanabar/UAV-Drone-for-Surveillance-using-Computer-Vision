# UAV-Drone-for-Surveillance-using-Computer-Vision
The project aimed to build a UAV Drone using Thermal Imaging and OpenCV Algorithm for surveillance. 
The model was built using thermal imaging along with Computer Vision algorithms which helped carry out detection and surveillance using a Raspberry Pi 4 Module along with a thermal camera.
